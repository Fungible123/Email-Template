## HTML Email Template
- This is a second project html email template.
- Website name: Rock On Tees

Published: https://fungible123.github.io/Email-Template/

### Design

- I designed my layout in Figma. 
- Check out the design here: https://www.figma.com/file/bUKA1gVGTunIjwIraVOUIlZZ/Email-Template?node-id=0%3A1

### Technologies:

#### MJML
 - Used MJML framework to build the html email template

#### Github
 - Used github pages to publish the website

### Difficulties:

#### MJML
 - Not much tight control over the layout
 - Some components have parameters that donâ€™t work as expected
 - You tend to not get super specific with the design
 - Language is pretty straightforward to use
 - Alternative technology I could use is Foundation for Emails. Might create a sample website using this technology in future projects.
